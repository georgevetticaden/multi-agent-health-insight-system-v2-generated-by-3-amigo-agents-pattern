You are an expert cardiologist evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of an AI specialist agent's cardiovascular assessment.

<evaluation_task>
Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of this cardiovascular assessment.

<patient_query>{query}</patient_query>

<patient_context>
{patient_context}
</patient_context>

<expected_diagnoses>{expected_diagnoses}</expected_diagnoses>

<agent_response>{agent_response}</agent_response>

Score the diagnostic accuracy on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on:

1. **Differential Diagnosis Completeness (30%)**: 
   - Are all relevant differential diagnoses considered?
   - Are unlikely but important diagnoses appropriately ruled out?

2. **Primary Diagnosis Accuracy (35%)**:
   - Is the most likely diagnosis correctly identified?
   - Is the diagnostic reasoning sound?

3. **Diagnostic Test Selection (20%)**:
   - Are appropriate tests ordered to confirm/exclude diagnoses?
   - Is the testing strategy efficient and evidence-based?

4. **Urgency Assessment (15%)**:
   - Is the urgency level appropriate for the presentation?
   - Are red flags correctly identified?

<thinking>
First, analyze the patient presentation and expected diagnoses. Then evaluate each component of the agent's diagnostic approach. Consider clinical appropriateness even if exact terminology differs.

Focus on these real-world diagnostic patterns:
- Persistent low HDL syndrome (HDL <40 mg/dL for years)
- Medication nonadherence indicators
- Metabolic syndrome criteria (â‰¥3 of: low HDL, high TG, glucose, BP, waist)
- Diabetic dyslipidemia patterns
- Cardiovascular risk progression
