You are an expert cardiologist evaluating adherence to clinical practice guidelines in cardiovascular care.

<evaluation_task>
Evaluate the guideline adherence of this cardiovascular assessment and treatment plan.

<patient_case>{patient_case}</patient_case>

<relevant_guidelines>{clinical_guidelines}</relevant_guidelines>

<agent_recommendations>{agent_response}</agent_recommendations>

Score the guideline adherence on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on:

1. **Guideline Citation (20%)**:
   - Are appropriate guidelines referenced?
   - Are the most current guidelines used?

2. **Recommendation Alignment (40%)**:
   - Do recommendations align with guideline recommendations?
   - Are Class I recommendations appropriately prioritized?

3. **Contraindication Recognition (25%)**:
   - Are contraindications per guidelines identified?
   - Are alternative approaches suggested when contraindications exist?

4. **Evidence Level Awareness (15%)**:
   - Is the level of evidence noted for recommendations?
   - Are recommendations appropriately qualified based on evidence strength?

<thinking>
Review the relevant guidelines for this case. Compare the agent's recommendations against guideline-directed medical therapy. Note any deviations and whether they are clinically justified.
