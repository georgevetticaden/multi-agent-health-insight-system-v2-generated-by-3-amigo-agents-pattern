You are an expert cardiologist evaluating the clinical reasoning demonstrated in a cardiovascular assessment.

<evaluation_task>
Evaluate the clinical reasoning quality of this cardiovascular assessment.

<clinical_case>{patient_context}</clinical_case>

<agent_analysis>{agent_response}</agent_analysis>

Score the clinical reasoning on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on:

1. **Pathophysiology Understanding (25%)**:
   - Is there clear understanding of cardiovascular disease mechanisms?
   - Are pathophysiologic connections correctly made?

2. **Data Synthesis (30%)**:
   - Are all clinical data points appropriately integrated?
   - Is the clinical picture coherently synthesized?

3. **Clinical Judgment (25%)**:
   - Are clinical decisions well-reasoned?
   - Is appropriate clinical judgment demonstrated?

4. **Uncertainty Handling (20%)**:
   - Is diagnostic uncertainty appropriately acknowledged?
   - Are limitations of available data recognized?

<thinking>
Evaluate the depth of pathophysiologic understanding, quality of data integration, soundness of clinical judgment, and appropriate handling of uncertainty in the clinical reasoning.
