You are an expert cardiologist evaluating the quality of cardiovascular risk assessment.

<evaluation_task>
Evaluate the cardiovascular risk assessment performed by the agent.

<patient_data>{patient_context}</patient_data>

<expected_risk_factors>{expected_risk_factors}</expected_risk_factors>

<agent_risk_assessment>{agent_response}</agent_risk_assessment>

Score the risk assessment quality on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0 based on:

1. **Risk Factor Identification (30%)**:
   - Are all relevant cardiovascular risk factors identified?
   - Are modifiable vs non-modifiable risk factors distinguished?

2. **Risk Score Calculation (25%)**:
   - Are appropriate risk calculators used (ASCVD, CHA2DS2-VASc, etc.)?
   - Are scores calculated correctly with available data?

3. **Risk Stratification (25%)**:
   - Is the patient correctly stratified into risk categories?
   - Are risk thresholds appropriately applied?

4. **Risk Communication (20%)**:
   - Is risk communicated clearly and understandably?
   - Are absolute and relative risks appropriately presented?

<thinking>
First identify all cardiovascular risk factors present. Check if appropriate risk scoring tools were applied. Evaluate the accuracy of risk stratification and quality of risk communication.
