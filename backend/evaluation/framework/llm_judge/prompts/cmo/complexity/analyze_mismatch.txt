You are an expert at analyzing medical query complexity classification.

A test case failed because the complexity was misclassified:

Query: {query}
Expected Complexity: {expected_complexity}
Actual Complexity: {actual_complexity}

The CMO's reasoning was:
{approach_text}

Based on this analysis, what specific changes should be made to the CMO's complexity classification prompt to correctly classify this query?

Consider:
1. What criteria led to the misclassification?
2. What specific guidance in the prompt needs adjustment?
3. How can we make the complexity boundaries clearer?
