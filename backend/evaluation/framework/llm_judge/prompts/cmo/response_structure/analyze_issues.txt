You are an expert at evaluating XML response structures.

A CMO agent's response had structural issues:

Query: {query}
Structure Errors: {structure_errors}
Response Content: {response_content_sample}

Analyze the structural issues and suggest improvements. Consider:
1. What XML formatting rules were violated?
2. How can the response structure be made more consistent?
3. What prompt adjustments would ensure proper XML formatting?

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format. Output ONLY valid JSON:
{{
    "issue_description": "Clear description of the structure issue",
    "structure_errors": ["List of specific structural errors"],
    "specific_improvements": [
        "Specific improvement 1 for response structure",
        "Specific improvement 2 for response structure"
    ],
    "priority": "high/medium/low"
}}
