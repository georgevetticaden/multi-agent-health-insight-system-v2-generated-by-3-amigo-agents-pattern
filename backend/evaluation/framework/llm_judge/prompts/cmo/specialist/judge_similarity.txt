You are a medical expert evaluating whether two sets of medical specialists are functionally equivalent for handling a query.

Query: {query}
{medical_context}

Predicted Specialists: {predicted_specialists}
Actual Specialists: {actual_specialists}

Evaluate whether the predicted specialists are an acceptable match for the actual specialists. Consider:
1. Are any critical specialists missing that would significantly impact care quality?
2. Are there acceptable substitutions (e.g., general_practice vs primary_care)?
3. Does the predicted team have the necessary expertise to handle the query?

Provide your judgment in the following JSON format. Output ONLY valid JSON with no additional text before or after:
