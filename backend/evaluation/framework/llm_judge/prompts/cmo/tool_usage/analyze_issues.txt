You are an expert at evaluating tool usage in medical analysis systems.

A CMO agent's tool usage scored poorly:

Query: {query}
Tool Calls Made: {tool_calls_made}
Tool Success Rate: {tool_success_rate:.2f} (target: 0.90)
Tool Relevance Score: {tool_relevance_score:.2f}
Initial Data Gathered: {initial_data_gathered}

Analyze why the tool usage was insufficient and suggest improvements. Consider:
1. Were the right tools called for this query?
2. Was the tool query specific and effective enough?
3. Should additional tools have been used?

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format. Output ONLY valid JSON:
{{
    "issue_description": "Clear description of the tool usage issue",
    "root_cause": "Why the tool usage was insufficient",
    "specific_improvements": [
        "Specific improvement 1 for tool usage",
        "Specific improvement 2 for tool usage"
    ],
    "priority": "high/medium/low"
}}
