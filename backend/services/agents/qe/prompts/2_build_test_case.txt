Based on the developer's observation, create or update a test case.

IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
1. First, provide a brief response acknowledging the developer's observation
2. Then emit a JSON object with the test case updates wrapped in ```json``` blocks
3. Finally, provide a brief follow-up message

Guidelines:
1. Start with actual values from the trace
2. Apply the developer's corrections as expected values
3. Don't analyze why something went wrong - just record what they observed
4. Use clear, descriptive test case IDs
5. Include relevant metadata from the trace

CRITICAL REFINEMENT RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
1. When the developer specifies a TOTAL COUNT (e.g., "should have 5 specialists", "team of 5"), the final expected list MUST have EXACTLY that many items
2. When they say "add X and Y" in the context of a total count, you must:
   - Count the existing items in actual_specialties
   - Add ONLY the specific items mentioned
   - Ensure the final count matches their stated total
3. Example: If actual has 3 specialists and they say "add laboratory medicine and preventive medicine to make 5 total":
   - Start with the 3 actual specialties
   - Add the 2 mentioned specialties
   - Result: exactly 5 specialists (not 6 or more)
4. NEVER add extra items like "data_analysis" unless explicitly mentioned
5. If there's a mismatch between items to add and the total count, prioritize the TOTAL COUNT

CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF CORRECT REFINEMENT:
Developer: "CMO should have created a team of 5 specialists. We need to add laboratory medicine and preventive medicine."
If actual_specialties = ["endocrinology", "pharmacy", "nutrition"] (3 items)
Then expected_specialties = ["endocrinology", "pharmacy", "nutrition", "laboratory_medicine", "preventive_medicine"] (EXACTLY 5 items)
DO NOT add "data_analysis" or any other specialist not mentioned!

Test case JSON structure:
```json
{
  "id": "descriptive_identifier",
  "query": "exact query from trace",
  "expected_complexity": "SIMPLE|STANDARD|COMPLEX|COMPREHENSIVE", 
  "actual_complexity": "what CMO actually assigned",
  "expected_specialties": ["array", "of", "expected", "specialists"],
  "actual_specialties": ["array", "of", "actual", "specialists"],
  "key_data_points": ["important", "data", "elements"],
  "category": "complexity_misclassification|specialist_selection|synthesis_quality|etc",
  "notes": "Developer's observations and the specific issue identified"
}
```

CRITICAL: After generating the test case JSON, you MUST provide a brief follow-up message like:
"I've updated the test case with your observation. You can refine it further or use the action buttons to run or save it."

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include the old verbose action menu. The UI now has action buttons for Run, Save, and Save & Run.
