Based on the developer's observation, create or update a test case.

IMPORTANT: You must ALWAYS show the action menu after generating a test case.

Guidelines:
1. Start with actual values from the trace
2. Apply the developer's corrections as expected values
3. Don't analyze why something went wrong - just record what they observed
4. Use clear, descriptive test case IDs
5. Include relevant metadata from the trace

CRITICAL REFINEMENT RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
1. When the developer specifies a TOTAL COUNT (e.g., "should have 5 specialists", "team of 5"), the final expected list MUST have EXACTLY that many items
2. When they say "add X and Y" in the context of a total count, you must:
   - Count the existing items in actual_specialties
   - Add ONLY the specific items mentioned
   - Ensure the final count matches their stated total
3. Example: If actual has 3 specialists and they say "add laboratory medicine and preventive medicine to make 5 total":
   - Start with the 3 actual specialties
   - Add the 2 mentioned specialties
   - Result: exactly 5 specialists (not 6 or more)
4. NEVER add extra items like "data_analysis" unless explicitly mentioned
5. If there's a mismatch between items to add and the total count, prioritize the TOTAL COUNT

CONCRETE EXAMPLE OF CORRECT REFINEMENT:
Developer: "CMO should have created a team of 5 specialists. We need to add laboratory medicine and preventive medicine."
If actual_specialties = {"endocrinology", "pharmacy", "nutrition"} (3 items)
Then expected_specialties = {"endocrinology", "pharmacy", "nutrition", "laboratory_medicine", "preventive_medicine"} (EXACTLY 5 items)
DO NOT add "data_analysis" or any other specialist not mentioned!

Test case structure:
- id: Descriptive identifier
- query: Exact query from trace
- expected_complexity: What developer says it should be
- actual_complexity: What CMO actually assigned
- expected_specialties: What developer expects
- actual_specialties: What was actually used
- key_data_points: Important data elements
- category: Type of error (complexity, specialists, synthesis, etc.)
- notes: Developer's observations

CRITICAL: After EVERY test case generation, you MUST ALWAYS include the following action menu IMMEDIATELY after the test case. DO NOT END YOUR RESPONSE WITHOUT INCLUDING THIS MENU:

What would you like to do with this test case?

**Refine the test case:**
- Update expected values or specialties
- Add more key data points
- Modify the description or category
- Add additional notes

**Execute actions:**
- Type "run" to execute the evaluation with this test case
- Type "save" to save this test case for later use
- Type "save and run" to save and execute

**Continue testing:**
- Type "new" to create another test case
- Type "list" to see saved test cases from this session

Just let me know what changes you'd like to make, or which action to take!
