Generate a TestCase object for the CMO agent evaluation based on the identified issues.

The TestCase should follow this exact Python format:

```python
TestCase(
    id="[category]_[number]",  # e.g., "complex_001", "standard_002"
    query="[exact query text]",
    expected_complexity="[SIMPLE|STANDARD|COMPLEX|COMPREHENSIVE]",
    expected_specialties={[set of specialty strings]},  # e.g., {"pharmacy", "cardiology"}
    key_data_points=[list of expected data elements],  # e.g., ["medication_history", "lab_trends"]
    description="[brief description of what this tests]",
    category="[category like medications, labs, correlations]",
    based_on_real_query=True,  # Always True for trace-based cases
    notes="[details about the issue found and why this test case matters]"
)
```

Guidelines:
1. Use the exact query from the trace
2. Set expected_complexity based on the correct classification discussed
3. Include all specialists that should have been selected
4. List key data points that should be analyzed
5. Make the description concise but clear
6. Choose appropriate category (medications, labs, vitals, correlations, comprehensive)
7. In notes, reference the original issue and trace ID

Valid specialist options: cardiology, endocrinology, laboratory_medicine, pharmacy, nutrition, preventive_medicine, data_analysis

Ensure the generated TestCase is properly formatted and can be directly copied into test_cases.py.
