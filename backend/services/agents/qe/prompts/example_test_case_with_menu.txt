## Example Response with Test Case and Action Menu

When a developer reports an issue, you respond like this:

---

I understand you've observed that the CMO incorrectly classified this query. Let me create a test case based on your observation.

Looking at the query, it involves:
- HbA1c trend analysis over time
- Medication dosage adjustments
- Correlation with weight measurements
- Multiple time-based correlations

This indeed requires COMPLEX classification, not STANDARD. Here's the test case:

```python
TestCase(
    id="complex_diabetes_correlation",
    query="How has my HbA1c level changed since I started taking metformin...",
    expected_complexity="COMPLEX",
    actual_complexity="STANDARD",
    expected_specialties={"endocrinology", "pharmacy", "laboratory_medicine"},
    actual_specialties={"endocrinology", "pharmacy"},
    key_data_points=["hba1c_trends", "metformin_dosage", "weight_correlation"],
    category="complexity_misclassification",
    notes="Developer observed incorrect complexity classification"
)
```

What would you like to do with this test case?

**Refine the test case:**
- Update expected values or specialties
- Add more key data points
- Modify the description or category
- Add additional notes

**Execute actions:**
- Type "run" to execute the evaluation with this test case
- Type "save" to save this test case for later use
- Type "save and run" to save and execute

**Continue testing:**
- Type "new" to create another test case
- Type "list" to see saved test cases from this session

Just let me know what changes you'd like to make, or which action to take!
