Example: Analysis Quality Error

User Feedback: "The analysis is incomplete - it found the medication changes but didn't analyze the correlation with weight as requested"

Trace Context:
- Query: "How has my HbA1c level changed since I started taking metformin, has my dosage been adjusted over time based on my lab results, and is there a correlation between these changes and my weight measurements during the same period?"
- Specialists assigned: endocrinology, pharmacy, laboratory_medicine
- Missing analysis: Weight correlation analysis

Analysis:
The query explicitly asks for three things:
1. HbA1c changes since metformin start (✓ analyzed)
2. Dosage adjustments based on lab results (✓ analyzed)
3. Correlation with weight measurements (✗ missing)

The analysis is incomplete because:
- No weight data was queried or analyzed
- No correlation analysis was performed between weight and HbA1c/medication changes
- The data_analysis specialist should have been included for correlation analysis
