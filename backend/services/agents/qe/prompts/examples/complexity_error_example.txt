Example: Complexity Classification Error

User Feedback: "This query was classified as STANDARD but it's asking for correlation between medications and lab results which should be COMPLEX"

Trace Context:
- Query: "How has my HbA1c level changed since I started taking metformin?"
- Classified as: STANDARD
- Assigned: endocrinology only

Analysis:
The query involves analyzing the relationship between medication (metformin) and lab results (HbA1c) over time. This requires:
1. Medication history analysis (pharmacy specialist)
2. Lab trend analysis (laboratory_medicine)
3. Correlation between the two (data_analysis)

This is clearly a COMPLEX query due to multi-factor correlation.
