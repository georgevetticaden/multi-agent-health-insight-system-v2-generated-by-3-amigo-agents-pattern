Key thresholds: LDL >100 mg/dL, HDL <40 mg/dL (men) or <50 mg/dL (women), Triglycerides >150 mg/dL, Total Cholesterol >200 mg/dL. Notable data gap exists from Nov 2022 to Apr 2025 for HDL/LDL.\n\nExpected Output: Cardiovascular risk assessment with trend analysis, calculated ratios over time, identification of high-risk periods, and interpretation of the 2022-2025 data gap's clinical significance\n\nMaximum Tool Calls Allowed: 5\n\nInstructions:\n1. Use the execute_health_query_v2 tool to gather relevant data for your analysis\n2. Focus on retrieving specific values, not just dates or test names\n3. Consider the time periods mentioned in the objective\n4. Make evidence-based findings supported by actual data\n5. Stay within your tool call limit - make each query count\n\nBegin your investigation now."

Data Gap Analysis (Nov 2022 - Apr 2025):**\n- Confirmed absence of HDL/LDL measurements for 2.5 years\n- Only triglyceride values available during this period (ranging 53-153 mg/dL)\n- **Clinical Significance**: This gap represents a critical monitoring lapse during which cardiovascular risk factors could have progressed undetected\n\n**2. High-Risk Periods Identified:**\n\n**Severe Risk Period (2013-2015):**\n- **December 2014**: Triglycerides peaked at 390 mg/dL (>2.5x upper limit)\n- HDL critically low at 25 mg/dL (severe cardiovascular risk)\n- **July 2015**: Triglycerides 210 mg/dL with HDL 33 mg/dL\n\n**Moderate-High Risk Period (2018-2019):**\n- Consistently low HDL (34-36 mg/dL) \n- Elevated triglycerides (172-188 mg/dL)\n- LDL exceeded 100 mg/dL threshold multiple times (103-114 mg/dL)\n\n**3. Calculated Risk Ratios:**\n\n**Total/HDL Ratio (Target <4.5):**\n- Worst: 6.48 (April 2019) - HIGH RISK\n- Best: 2.52 (July 2021)\n- Most recent complete panel (Nov 2022): 3.02\n\n**LDL/HDL Ratio (Target <2.5):**\n- Worst: 3.17 (October 2018) - ELEVATED RISK\n- Best: 1.23 (July 2021)\n- Most recent (Nov 2022): 1.64\n\n**4. Current Status (April 2025):**\n- Total Cholesterol: 149 mg/dL (optimal)\n- HDL: 33 mg/dL (critically low - major risk factor)\n- LDL: 85 mg/dL (near optimal)\n- Triglycerides: 153 mg/dL (borderline high)\n- Total/HDL Ratio: 4.52 (elevated risk)\n\n### Trend Analysis:\n\n**Positive Trends:**\n- LDL cholesterol improved from peaks of 114-122 mg/dL to current 85 mg/dL\n- Total cholesterol normalized from highs of 181-186 mg/dL\n- Triglycerides significantly improved from extreme values (390 mg/dL)\n\n**Concerning Patterns:**\n- HDL remains persistently low throughout 15 years (25-47 mg/dL range)\n- HDL has worsened recently: 42 mg/dL (Nov 2022) to 33 mg/dL (Apr 2025)\n- Patient has NEVER achieved optimal HDL levels (>60 mg/dL)\n\n### Clinical Interpretation:\n\n1. **Primary Risk Factor**: Chronically low HDL cholesterol represents the most significant and persistent cardiovascular risk factor, indicating impaired reverse cholesterol transport\n\n2. **Risk Category**: Currently MODERATE-HIGH cardiovascular risk despite improved LDL levels, primarily due to:\n   - HDL <40 mg/dL (independent major risk factor)\n   - Total/HDL ratio >4.5\n   - History of severe dyslipidemia\n\n3. **Data Gap Impact**: The 2.5-year monitoring gap is clinically concerning as it coincided with HDL deterioration (42→33 mg/dL), suggesting possible:\n   - Medication non-adherence\n   - Lifestyle changes\n   - Unmonitored disease progression\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Immediate comprehensive lipid panel with apolipoprotein assessment\n- Consider advanced cardiovascular imaging given persistent HDL dysfunction\n- Evaluate for secondary causes of low HDL\n- Intensive lifestyle modification focusing on HDL optimization\n- Consider pharmacological interventions specifically targeting HDL/triglycerides",

Data Gap Analysis (Nov 2022 - Apr 2025):**\n- Confirmed absence of HDL/LDL measurements for 2.5 years\n- Only triglyceride values available during this period (ranging 53-153 mg/dL)\n- **Clinical Significance**: This gap represents a critical monitoring lapse during which cardiovascular risk factors could have progressed undetected\n\n**2. High-Risk Periods Identified:**\n\n**Severe Risk Period (2013-2015):**\n- **December 2014**: Triglycerides peaked at 390 mg/dL (>2.5x upper limit)\n- HDL critically low at 25 mg/dL (severe cardiovascular risk)\n- **July 2015**: Triglycerides 210 mg/dL with HDL 33 mg/dL\n\n**Moderate-High Risk Period (2018-2019):**\n- Consistently low HDL (34-36 mg/dL) \n- Elevated triglycerides (172-188 mg/dL)\n- LDL exceeded 100 mg/dL threshold multiple times (103-114 mg/dL)\n\n**3. Calculated Risk Ratios:**\n\n**Total/HDL Ratio (Target <4.5):**\n- Worst: 6.48 (April 2019) - HIGH RISK\n- Best: 2.52 (July 2021)\n- Most recent complete panel (Nov 2022): 3.02\n\n**LDL/HDL Ratio (Target <2.5):**\n- Worst: 3.17 (October 2018) - ELEVATED RISK\n- Best: 1.23 (July 2021)\n- Most recent (Nov 2022): 1.64\n\n**4. Current Status (April 2025):**\n- Total Cholesterol: 149 mg/dL (optimal)\n- HDL: 33 mg/dL (critically low - major risk factor)\n- LDL: 85 mg/dL (near optimal)\n- Triglycerides: 153 mg/dL (borderline high)\n- Total/HDL Ratio: 4.52 (elevated risk)\n\n### Trend Analysis:\n\n**Positive Trends:**\n- LDL cholesterol improved from peaks of 114-122 mg/dL to current 85 mg/dL\n- Total cholesterol normalized from highs of 181-186 mg/dL\n- Triglycerides significantly improved from extreme values (390 mg/dL)\n\n**Concerning Patterns:**\n- HDL remains persistently low throughout 15 years (25-47 mg/dL range)\n- HDL has worsened recently: 42 mg/dL (Nov 2022) to 33 mg/dL (Apr 2025)\n- Patient has NEVER achieved optimal HDL levels (>60 mg/dL)\n\n### Clinical Interpretation:\n\n1. **Primary Risk Factor**: Chronically low HDL cholesterol represents the most significant and persistent cardiovascular risk factor, indicating impaired reverse cholesterol transport\n\n2. **Risk Category**: Currently MODERATE-HIGH cardiovascular risk despite improved LDL levels, primarily due to:\n   - HDL <40 mg/dL (independent major risk factor)\n   - Total/HDL ratio >4.5\n   - History of severe dyslipidemia\n\n3. **Data Gap Impact**: The 2.5-year monitoring gap is clinically concerning as it coincided with HDL deterioration (42→33 mg/dL), suggesting possible:\n   - Medication non-adherence\n   - Lifestyle changes\n   - Unmonitored disease progression\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Immediate comprehensive lipid panel with apolipoprotein assessment\n- Consider advanced cardiovascular imaging given persistent HDL dysfunction\n- Evaluate for secondary causes of low HDL\n- Intensive lifestyle modification focusing on HDL optimization\n- Consider pharmacological interventions specifically targeting HDL/triglycerides\n\nUSER: Based on your investigation and the data you've gathered, provide your specialist analysis in the following structured format:\n\n<findings>\nProvide a 2-3 sentence summary of your key findings. Focus on the most important patterns, values, or insights discovered.\n</findings>\n\n<recommendations>\n- List 2-4 specific, actionable recommendations based on your findings\n- Each recommendation should be clear and evidence-based\n- Consider both immediate actions and long-term monitoring\n</recommendations>\n\n<concerns>\n- List any urgent health concerns that require immediate attention\n- Include critical values or dangerous trends\n- Leave this section empty if there are no urgent concerns\n</concerns>\n\n<confidence>\nProvide a confidence level (0.0-1.0) based on:\n- Completeness of available data\n- Recency of the data\n- Relevance to the query\nExample: 0.85\n</confidence>\n\nRemember: Be specific, cite actual values when relevant, and ensure your analysis directly addresses the assigned objective.",

Data Gap Analysis (Nov 2022 - Apr 2025):**\n- Confirmed absence of HDL/LDL measurements for 2.5 years\n- Only triglyceride values available during this period (ranging 53-153 mg/dL)\n- **Clinical Significance**: This gap represents a critical monitoring lapse during which cardiovascular risk factors could have progressed undetected\n\n**2. High-Risk Periods Identified:**\n\n**Severe Risk Period (2013-2015):**\n- **December 2014**: Triglycerides peaked at 390 mg/dL (>2.5x upper limit)\n- HDL critically low at 25 mg/dL (severe cardiovascular risk)\n- **July 2015**: Triglycerides 210 mg/dL with HDL 33 mg/dL\n\n**Moderate-High Risk Period (2018-2019):**\n- Consistently low HDL (34-36 mg/dL) \n- Elevated triglycerides (172-188 mg/dL)\n- LDL exceeded 100 mg/dL threshold multiple times (103-114 mg/dL)\n\n**3. Calculated Risk Ratios:**\n\n**Total/HDL Ratio (Target <4.5):**\n- Worst: 6.48 (April 2019) - HIGH RISK\n- Best: 2.52 (July 2021)\n- Most recent complete panel (Nov 2022): 3.02\n\n**LDL/HDL Ratio (Target <2.5):**\n- Worst: 3.17 (October 2018) - ELEVATED RISK\n- Best: 1.23 (July 2021)\n- Most recent (Nov 2022): 1.64\n\n**4. Current Status (April 2025):**\n- Total Cholesterol: 149 mg/dL (optimal)\n- HDL: 33 mg/dL (critically low - major risk factor)\n- LDL: 85 mg/dL (near optimal)\n- Triglycerides: 153 mg/dL (borderline high)\n- Total/HDL Ratio: 4.52 (elevated risk)\n\n### Trend Analysis:\n\n**Positive Trends:**\n- LDL cholesterol improved from peaks of 114-122 mg/dL to current 85 mg/dL\n- Total cholesterol normalized from highs of 181-186 mg/dL\n- Triglycerides significantly improved from extreme values (390 mg/dL)\n\n**Concerning Patterns:**\n- HDL remains persistently low throughout 15 years (25-47 mg/dL range)\n- HDL has worsened recently: 42 mg/dL (Nov 2022) to 33 mg/dL (Apr 2025)\n- Patient has NEVER achieved optimal HDL levels (>60 mg/dL)\n\n### Clinical Interpretation:\n\n1. **Primary Risk Factor**: Chronically low HDL cholesterol represents the most significant and persistent cardiovascular risk factor, indicating impaired reverse cholesterol transport\n\n2. **Risk Category**: Currently MODERATE-HIGH cardiovascular risk despite improved LDL levels, primarily due to:\n   - HDL <40 mg/dL (independent major risk factor)\n   - Total/HDL ratio >4.5\n   - History of severe dyslipidemia\n\n3. **Data Gap Impact**: The 2.5-year monitoring gap is clinically concerning as it coincided with HDL deterioration (42→33 mg/dL), suggesting possible:\n   - Medication non-adherence\n   - Lifestyle changes\n   - Unmonitored disease progression\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Immediate comprehensive lipid panel with apolipoprotein assessment\n- Consider advanced cardiovascular imaging given persistent HDL dysfunction\n- Evaluate for secondary causes of low HDL\n- Intensive lifestyle modification focusing on HDL optimization\n- Consider pharmacological interventions specifically targeting HDL/triglycerides"

I want to see trends across the top 4 cholesterol metrics including Triglycerides across that time period (standard)\"\nQuery Type: time_series\n\n## Medical Analysis Summary:\n## Your Cholesterol Trends Over the Last 15 Years\n\nBased on comprehensive analysis of your cholesterol data from 2010-2025, here are the trends for your four main cholesterol metrics:\n\n### 📊 15-Year Trend Summary\n\n**1. Total Cholesterol**\n- **2013-2014**: Started at 155-160 mg/dL\n- **Peak**: 178.5 mg/dL (2018)\n- **Current**: 149 mg/dL (April 2025)\n- **Trend**: Overall improvement with 17% reduction from peak\n\n**2. LDL Cholesterol (\"Bad\" Cholesterol)**\n- **2014**: Started tracking at 110 mg/dL\n- **Best**: 63 mg/dL (2019)\n- **Current**: 85 mg/dL (April 2025)\n- **Trend**: Excellent control, maintaining below 100 mg/dL target\n\n**3. HDL Cholesterol (\"Good\" Cholesterol)**\n- **Crisis Period (2013-2014)**: Dangerously low at 20-25 mg/dL\n- **Best**: 47 mg/dL (2020)\n- **Current**: 33 mg/dL (April 2025) ⚠️\n- **Trend**: Concerning 24% decline from 2023 levels\n\n**4. Triglycerides**\n- **Crisis Period (2013-2014)**: Severely elevated at 390-426 mg/dL\n- **Best**: 64 mg/dL (2023)\n- **Current**: 153 mg/dL (April 2025)\n- **Trend**: Dramatic improvement from crisis, but recent doubling from 2023 levels\n\n### 📈 Key Patterns Identified\n\n1. **Recovery from Crisis (2013-2015)**: You experienced a severe lipid crisis with triglycerides over 400 mg/dL and HDL below 25 mg/dL, which you successfully managed.\n\n2. **Stable Period (2016-2022)**: Maintained good control with regular monitoring and consistent improvements across all metrics.\n\n3. **Recent Deterioration (2023-2025)**: After a 2.5-year monitoring gap, both HDL and triglycerides have worsened significantly.\n\n### 🚨 Immediate Concerns\n\nYour HDL cholesterol at 33 mg/dL is critically low (target >40 mg/dL for men), representing your primary cardiovascular risk factor despite excellent LDL control. The recent triglyceride increase to 153 mg/dL, while not severe, indicates metabolic changes requiring attention.\n\n### 💡 Recommended Actions\n\n1. **Immediate Steps**:\n   - Schedule comprehensive lipid panel within 2 weeks\n   - Begin 150+ minutes we...\n\n## Key Data Points Mentioned in Analysis:\n{\n  \"mentioned_values\": [\n    {\n      \"value\": 160.0,\n      \"unit\": \"mg/dL\",\n      \"context\": \"\",\n      \"surrounding_text\": \"tal Cholesterol**\\n- **2013-2014**: Started at 155-160 mg/dL\\n- **Peak**: 178.5 mg/dL (2018)\\n- **Current**: 149 \"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": 178.5,\n      \"unit\": \"mg/dL\",\n      \"context\": \"2018\",\n      \"surrounding_text\": \"2013-2014**: Started at 155-160 mg/dL\\n- **Peak**: 178.5 mg/dL (2018)\\n- **Current**: 149 mg/dL (April 2025)\\n- **Trend**\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": 149.0,\n      \"unit\": \"mg/dL\",\n      \"context\": \"April 2025\",\n      \"surrounding_text\": \"/dL\\n- **Peak**: 178.5 mg/dL (2018)\\n- **Current**: 149 mg/dL (April 2025)\\n- **Trend**: Overall improvement with 17% reducti\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"value\": 17.0,\n      \"unit\": \"%\",\n      \"context\": \"\",\n      \"surrounding_text\": \"April 2025)\\n- **Trend**: Overall improvement with 17% reduction from peak\\n\\n**2.

'bg-green-50 border-green-200' : 'bg-red-50 border-red-200');\n  };\n  \n  const getTrendClass = (trend) => {\n    return 'flex items-center gap-1 ' + (trend < 0 ? 'text-green-600' : 'text-red-600');\n  };\n\n  // Create metric cards with latest values\n  // Create line chart with reference ranges\n  // Add key findings section\n  return (\n    <div className=\"p-6 bg-gray-50\">\n      {/* Example of correct className usage */}\n      <div className={getMetricCardClass(true)}>\n        {/* Content */}\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\n## Component Structure:\nconst HealthVisualization = () => {\n  // Extract data from the medical analysis\n  const rawData = [\n    // IMPORTANT: Use the EXACT values mentioned in the medical analysis\n    // Example: If analysis says \"cholesterol was 149 mg/dL on April 7, 2025\"\n    { date: \"2025-04-07\", metric: \"Total Cholesterol\", value: 149, unit: \"mg/dL\" },\n    // Add all data points mentioned in the synthesis\n  ];\n  \n  // Process and visualize the data\n  // ... rest of component\n};\n\n## Available Components (already imported):\n- Recharts: LineChart, BarChart, AreaChart, PieChart, ScatterChart, ComposedChart, Line, Bar, Area, Pie, Scatter, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer, ReferenceLine, ReferenceArea, Cell\n- Lucide icons: Activity, Heart, TrendingUp, TrendingDown, AlertCircle, CheckCircle, Info, Calendar, Clock, User, Droplet, Pill, Scale, Brain, Shield, Target, AlertTriangle, ArrowUp, ArrowDown\n- React hooks: useState, useEffect\n\n## Quality Requirements:\n- Must be visually compelling and professional\n- Must directly answer the user's query\n- Must match the data and findings in the medical analysis\n- Include proper error handling for edge cases\n- Use Tailwind CSS for beautiful styling\n- Add hover effects and interactivity where appropriate\n\nIMPORTANT: \n- Start DIRECTLY with: const HealthVisualization = () => {\n- DO NOT include imports or exports\n- DO NOT use a data prop - embed the data\n- Keep under 400 lines for reliable generation\n- Ensure ALL JSX syntax is valid (use &lt; for < in text)\n- Include proper TypeScript-style data structure even though this is JavaScript\n\nCRITICAL JSX RULES TO AVOID BABEL ERRORS:\n- NEVER use template literals inside JSX attributes\n- BAD: className={`flex ${isActive ? 'bg-blue' : 'bg-gray'}`}\n- GOOD: className={isActive ? 'flex bg-blue' : 'flex bg-gray'}\n- GOOD: className={'flex ' + (isActive ? 'bg-blue' : 'bg-gray')}\n- For complex className logic, compute it BEFORE the JSX:\n  const cardClass = 'flex items-center ' + (isActive ? 'bg-blue' : 'bg-gray');\n  return <div className={cardClass}>\n\nGenerate the COMPLETE component with embedded data that tells the story from the medical analysis."
