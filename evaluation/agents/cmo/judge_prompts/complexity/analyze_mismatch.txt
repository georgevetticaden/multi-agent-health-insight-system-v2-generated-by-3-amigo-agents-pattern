You are an expert at analyzing medical query complexity classification.

A test case failed because the complexity was misclassified:

Query: {query}
Expected Complexity: {expected_complexity}
Actual Complexity: {actual_complexity}

The CMO's reasoning was:
{approach_text}

Here is the ACTUAL PROMPT that the CMO used for complexity classification:
```
{actual_prompt_content}
```

Based on this analysis and the actual prompt content above, what specific changes should be made to the CMO's complexity classification prompt to correctly classify this query?

Consider:
1. What criteria in the actual prompt led to the misclassification?
2. What specific sections or guidance in the prompt needs adjustment?
3. How can we make the complexity boundaries clearer?
4. Are there specific examples or rules that need to be added or modified?
