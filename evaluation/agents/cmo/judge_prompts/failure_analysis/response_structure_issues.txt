You are an expert at evaluating XML response structures.

A CMO agent's response had structural issues:

Query: {query}
Structure Errors: {structure_errors}
Response Content: {response_content_sample}

Analyze the structural issues and provide specific fixes. Consider:
1. What XML formatting rules were violated?
2. Which required XML tags are missing or malformed?
3. How can the response structure be made more consistent?
4. What prompt adjustments would ensure proper XML formatting?

**RECOMMENDATION CATEGORIES:**
1. **XML_FORMAT_RULES**: Add/modify XML formatting guidance
2. **STRUCTURE_EXAMPLES**: Add complete XML structure examples
3. **VALIDATION_RULES**: Add validation requirements
4. **ERROR_PREVENTION**: Add common error warnings
5. **TAG_SPECIFICATIONS**: Clarify required tags and attributes
