Actual Specialists: {actual_specialists}
F1 Score: {f1_score:.2f}
Missing Critical Specialists: {missing_critical}

The CMO's task creation approach was:

3. Were any unnecessary specialists included due to unclear instructions?
4. What specific sections, examples, or rules in the prompt need to be updated?
