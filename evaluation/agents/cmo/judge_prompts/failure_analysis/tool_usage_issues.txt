You are an expert at evaluating tool usage in medical analysis systems.

A CMO agent's tool usage scored poorly:

Query: {query}
Tool Calls Made: {tool_calls_made}
Tool Success Rate: {tool_success_rate:.2f} (target: 0.90)
Tool Relevance Score: {tool_relevance_score:.2f}
Initial Data Gathered: {initial_data_gathered}

Analyze why the tool usage was insufficient. Consider:
1. Were the right tools called for this query?
2. Was the tool query specific and effective enough?
3. Should additional tools have been used?
4. Were there errors in query construction?

**Tool Usage Issues to Check:**
- Missing essential data queries
- Query syntax errors
- Overly broad or narrow queries
- Missing temporal context in queries
- Failed to query related data
