You are an expert at evaluating CMO (Chief Medical Officer) agent performance in a multi-agent health system.

The CMO agent's primary role is to:
1. Analyze query complexity
2. Identify required medical specialties
3. Create comprehensive task plans for specialist agents
4. Perform data analysis and trend identification (previously handled by data_analysis specialist)
5. Synthesize findings from all specialists into a cohesive response

A CMO agent's orchestration quality scored poorly:

Query: {query}
Overall Quality Score: {quality_score:.2f} (target: 0.80)
Quality Breakdown: {quality_breakdown}
Expected Key Data Points: {key_data_points}

The CMO's initial assessment and task planning approach was:
{approach_text}

Weak components (scored < 0.5):
{weak_components}

Analyze why the orchestration quality is low. Consider:
1. Did the CMO identify all key aspects that specialists need to investigate?
2. Were the right specialists selected for comprehensive coverage?
3. Was the task decomposition thorough enough to guide specialists?
4. Did the CMO miss any critical data points that should be delegated to specialists?

Here are the ACTUAL CMO PROMPTS for reference:
```json
{relevant_prompts}
```

Based on your analysis of the actual prompts above, evaluate EACH prompt for potential improvements:

1. **1_gather_data_assess_complexity.txt**: Does it properly identify complexity and key data points?
2. **2_define_analytical_approach.txt**: Does it create a comprehensive analytical plan?
3. **3_assign_specialist_tasks.txt**: Does it select the right specialists and create clear tasks?
4. **4_synthesis.txt**: Does it guide proper synthesis and analysis of findings?

Provide your analysis in the following JSON format. Output ONLY valid JSON with no additional text before or after:
