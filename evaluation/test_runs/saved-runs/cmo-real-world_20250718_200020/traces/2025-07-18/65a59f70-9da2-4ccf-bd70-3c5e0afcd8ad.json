For temporal queries: When a patient asks about \"all\" their data or historical trends, specialists must query the ENTIRE available history, not just recent months\n3. Each specialist should have clear, measurable objectives\n4. Assign tool query suggestions that will retrieve actual data values\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LAB-RELATED QUERIES:\n- When the patient asks about lab values (cholesterol, glucose, HbA1c, etc.), the objective should focus on ACTUAL TEST VALUES and TRENDS\n- For \"cholesterol trend\" queries, the objective should be to retrieve actual cholesterol values (Total, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides) with dates\n- Do NOT create objectives about \"test coverage timeline\" or \"testing history\" unless specifically asked\n- The context should direct specialists to query for specific lab results with their numeric values, not just when tests were performed\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR DATE RANGES:\n- When the patient asks for \"entire data\", \"all my data\", \"complete history\", or \"full timeline\", specialists MUST query for ALL available historical data\n- The patient has data going back to 2013 - ensure specialists know to query the COMPLETE date range when requested\n- For \"cholesterol trend over my entire data\", the query should explicitly request: \"all cholesterol results from 2013 to present\"\n- Do NOT limit queries to recent years unless the patient specifically asks for a limited timeframe\n- Include in the context/tool_queries section explicit date range instructions when the patient wants complete historical data\n\nGuidelines:\n- STANDARD queries need 3 specialists\n- Each specialist gets up to 5 tool calls\n- Tasks should be specific and measurable\n- Avoid overlap between specialists\n\nAvailable specialists (use exact lowercase values):\n- cardiology: Heart health, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease\n- endocrinology: Diabetes, thyroid, hormones, metabolic health\n- laboratory_medicine: Lab tests, blood work, diagnostic results\n- pharmacy: Medications, dosages, interactions, adherence\n- nutrition: Diet, weight, nutritional health\n- preventive_medicine: Risk factors, screening, prevention\n\nFormat each task as XML within a tasks wrapper:\n\n<tasks>\n<task>\n  <specialist>lowercase_specialist_name</specialist>\n  <objective>Specific, measurable objective</objective>\n  <context>Relevant context including initial findings</context>\n  <expected_output>Concrete deliverables expected</expected_output>\n  <priority>1-5 (1 being highest)</priority>\n  <tool_queries>Suggested queries to retrieve the needed data</tool_queries>\n</task>\n<!-- Add more tasks as needed -->\n</tasks>\n\nCreate 3 specialist tasks based on the complexity level."
