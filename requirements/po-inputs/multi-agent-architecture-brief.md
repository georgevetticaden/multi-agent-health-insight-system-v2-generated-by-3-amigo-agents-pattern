# Multi-Agent Architecture Brief for Health Insight System

## Executive Summary

We need to build a sophisticated health insight system that can analyze complex health data and provide comprehensive medical insights. Based on Anthropic's research (documented in ["How we built our multi-agent research system"](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/built-multi-agent-research-system)) showing 90.2% performance improvement with multi-agent systems over single agents, we will implement an orchestrator-worker pattern with specialized medical agents.

## Core Architecture Pattern

### Orchestrator Agent (Chief Medical Officer - CMO)
- Analyzes query complexity
- Delegates to appropriate specialists
- Synthesizes findings from multiple specialists
- Ensures comprehensive coverage of health concerns

### Specialist Agents (Medical Team)
1. **Cardiology Specialist** - Heart health, blood pressure, cardiovascular risk
2. **Laboratory Medicine Specialist** - Lab results interpretation, reference ranges
3. **Endocrinology Specialist** - Hormones, diabetes, metabolic health
4. **Data Analysis Specialist** - Statistical trends, correlations, predictions
5. **Preventive Medicine Specialist** - Risk assessment, screening recommendations
6. **Pharmacy Specialist** - Medications, interactions, adherence
7. **Nutrition Specialist** - Diet analysis, weight management
8. **General Practice Specialist** - Overall health coordination

### Visualization Agent
- Generates interactive React components
- Creates data visualizations (time series, comparisons, distributions)
- Produces self-contained, executable chart components

## Key Requirements

### Performance
- Parallel execution of specialist agents
- Real-time streaming updates via SSE
- Query response time < 5 seconds for simple queries
- Comprehensive analysis for complex queries

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure of specialist activities
- Live status updates showing which specialists are working
- Clear synthesis of multiple specialist opinions
- Interactive visualizations for data exploration

### Data Integration
- Health data access is abstracted through pre-built tools
- Tool-based data access using Anthropic's native tool calling
- Natural language query capabilities for each specialist
- No direct database access needed - all queries go through the tool interface

## Technical Constraints

1. **Token Usage**: Multi-agent systems use ~15x more tokens but provide significantly better results
2. **Coordination Complexity**: CMO must effectively orchestrate specialists
3. **Error Handling**: System must gracefully handle individual specialist failures
4. **Context Management**: Each specialist receives focused context, not entire history

## Success Metrics

- 90%+ improvement in diagnostic completeness
- Zero critical health insights missed
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Ability to identify complex health patterns across multiple domains
